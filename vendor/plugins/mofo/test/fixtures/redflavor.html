        <p>Here comes a small update of my work of my master thesis. It would be more
        correct to talk about the recent <em>lack</em> of work on my master thesis. I took
        slightly early holiday break from my writing, hoping to jump right back into
        it after new years. Sadly I became ill on the first day of this year, and have
        been since then. Things are getting better (at last) so I hope I&#8217;ll be able to
        start working again tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p>I&#8217;ve been struggeling with my productivity and I&#8217;ll often go into
        procrastination modus. I read an article about <a href="http://www.academicproductivity.com/blog/2008/how-to-complete-your-phd-or-any-large-project-hard-and-soft-deadlines-and-the-martini-method/">academic productivity</a>
        today and hope to introduce the following techniques into my work process:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Hard deadlines. I have a hard deadlines on May the 1st this year. A pitty
        it&#8217;s quite easy to get an extension to this deadline.</li>
        <li>Soft deadlines. Last year me and my supervisor agreed that I&#8217;d deliver
        written material fourthnightly. This worked quite well, but often I felt I
        worked hard one week before the delivery and not so hard the other week.</li>
        <li>The martini method. Write <em>n</em> number of words each day before going home.
        500-1000 is a good number.</li>
        <li>The chain method. Cross of your calendar each day if you&#8217;ve completed what
        you intended. Try not to break the chain.</li>

        <p>The meeting began at 13:00 and lasted approximately 60 minutes.</p>
        
        <h3>Feedback on Delivery</h3>
        
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s point about the Giant Global Graph is quite interesting. It
        shows how social navigation across several web pages is becoming mainstream
        with mashups, Facebook&#8217;s applications, and OpenSocial. There is a correlation
        between the Graph (the Semantic Web) and Web 2.0 even though Web 2.0 is a more
        widespread term. I should state the interesting of this phenomena but that
        it&#8217;s left out of my research due to time concerns.</p>
        
        <p>When discussing collaborative filtering it would be important to
        differentiate by group and friendship based filtering and content based
        filtering. Is this two fundamental parts of social navigation categorization?
        From this we could actually create a hypothesis that social
        navigation either is friendship based or content based. This could fit nicely
        into my discussion chapter where we look at larger groupings of social
        navigation than for instance hyperlink sharing, social annotation, etc.
        Examples of already defined groupings of social navigation, although at
        another dimension, is implicit and explicit social navigation.</p>
        
        <p>While studying social navigation it becomes apparent that privacy concerns is
        a central theme. By using user profiles targeted filtering of for example ads
        can be archived (and actually is implemented in Facebook&#8217;s Beacon). This area
        of study could warrant an entirely new master thesis so at this point it&#8217;s
        best to state that I&#8217;ll have to ignore such concerns.</p>
        
        <p>Separation between the background chapter and the analysis chapter have to be
        clearer:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>The background chapter should reference and comment on third party
        literature and data.</li>
        <li>The analysis chapter should introduce my findings from primary data.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In my analysis I could introduce relevant web pages as del.icio.us, trailfire
        etc. before discussion the other services in depth. Superficial analysis of
        these should perhaps be described in the methodology chapter.</p>
        
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        
        <p>I should finish my background chapter and then begin to focus on my analysis.
        I could very well begin content inventories for Facebook and Amazon before
        concluding my Flickr analysis.</p>

        <p>After talking about minor details that could be improved on (added to my task
        list) we talked about collaborative filtering being a central part of social
        navigation. I&#8217;ll have to reference systems as GroupLens. The interestingness
        algorithm of Flickr is interesting in this vein (no pun intended). Several
        people have tried to reverse engineer it and understand how it works. Whats
        striking is that comments and favorite attributions from friends counts less
        than from strangers. Flickr&#8217;s reasoning must be that friends is biased and
        easier to persuade. There is third party applications like <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/scout.php">Scout</a> that
        enables you to track your interestingness score over time.</p>
        
        <p>One interesting thing about Flickr is how it separates family and friends. You
        share you personal photos with your family and share your obscene party photos
        with your friends. You don&#8217;t want these to correlate.</p>
        
        <p>When discussing and analyzing Flickr I need to refer to and use my content
        inventory more clearly.</p>
        
        <p>I need to establish the broad lines of my thesis:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <li>Background
        <ul>
        <li>how the literature was collected (describe it pragmatically)</li>
        <li>literature review (summary, analysis, and comparisons)</li>
        <li>introduction to terms as folksonomy, tagging, geotagging, etc</li>
        <li>paragraph or two about my subject related to popular literature (search
        <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/scout.php">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.loc.gov">Library of Congress</a> and say something like:
        there were X books about this subject, the first was published in 2001
        but the majority of books were published the last two years, and maybe
        show a graph)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Methodology
        <ul>
        <li>how data was collected, the methodology</li>
        <li>content inventory in computer science context (Morville and co), not as
        detailed as in media studies</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Data chapter
        <ul>
        <li>the collected data of Flickr, Facebook, Amazon, etc</li>
        <li>huge tables from content inventory should be in the appendix</li>
        <li>should provide aggregate data from data in appendix</li>
        <li>screenshots is probably best included here and not in the appendix</li>
        <li>discuss the collected data</li>
        <li>would be my content analysis chapter as it stands now</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Synthesis (or discussion)
        <ul>
        <li>with base in the analysis the larger lines are presented</li>
        <li>present a new and refreshed terminology for the field</li>
        <li>would be nice to find patterns of navigational use that can be named and
        presented with working examples (group pools is a type of patterns that
        we will call X and is also found in product Y and Z for example)</li>
        <li>create a taxonomy of the field</li>
        <li>place examples from the analysis into these taxanomical categories</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Reflection and further work</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>My working title and working in the introductory chapter is using *web
        services* and this is currently associated with APIs as REST and SOAP and so on. <em>Web sites</em> is probably a better description than <em>web applications</em>
        since the latter is more increasingly being used to talk about specific task
        related applications for end users, leveraged on the web (Google docs, etc).</p>
        
        <p>When writing my literature review it would be sufficient to reference the most
        recent or the most representative article where there are several from the same
        authors with the same application and theme.</p>
        
        <p>Lastly it would be beneficial to use the comments field in BibTeX to annotate
        my readings and thereby be able to create an annotated bibliography for my own
        use.</p>

      <div class='entry-content'>
        <p>In my introductory chapter there were several examples where I&#8217;d jumped to
        conclusions without backing them up with data. First my citing about the rise
        of blog usage from X to Y percent in 18 months was confusing. Was this for the
        general population? The numbers seemed to high, the study participants had to
        come from some demographical niche.</p>
        
        <p>Further I had concluded that developers seeking profits wanted as high a
        user-base as possible. Could it be on some occasions that they wanted a large
        user-base just for the social benefits it gives (collective intelligence)? I
        had clearly jumped on a description of the world without any underlying
        research. Instead I should focus on referencing research on self sufficient
        user-bases from secondary literature like Jenny Preece (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Online-Communities-Designing-Supporting-Sociability/dp/0471805998/">Online Communities:
        Designing Usability and Supporting Sociability</a>).</p>
        
        <p>When I wrote that innovation was happening because of competition amongst
        developers I jumped on conclusions again. This can be rewritten by turning it
        upside down: &#8220;When conducting my introductory studies I frequented many social
        networking sites and my feeling is that lot of innovation is happening in this
        space&#8221;.</p>
        
        <p>Again I make the same mistake when I conclude that one not can create sound
        navigation systems without using social navigation. I don&#8217;t have to say theses
        things for motivating my research. Be straight, base writing on observations
        and let the writing reflect reality: &#8220;Social navigation have become more
        important the latest years, it&#8217;s more prevalent in mainstream media and is a
        central term in Web 2.0.&#8221; One can quantify media&#8217;s use of terms by searching
        for them in different time intervals (for example the 10 first months of this
        year and the same period a year ago). Two services for this are <a href="http://www.retriever-info.com/atekst.php">ATEKST</a>,
        a Norwegian media database and <a href="http://trends.google.com">Google Trends</a>.</p>
        
        <p>My supervisor also reacted on the fact that I&#8217;d written that there were only a
        handful of research projects on social navigation related to the web. He was
        thinking on more broader terms and included Web 2.0, social networks into his
        understanding of social navigation. I focused on navigation only, and
        therefore had fewer papers to reference. He thought such a tight focus would
        only be beneficial in my research. This can be solved by writing: &#8220;In my
        literature review I used these methods for searching (keyword, citation) and
        found X relevant academic articles. In the field of navigation on the web,
        but not with a focus on sociality there are Y articles. Sociality on the web
        on the other hand has Z articles.&#8221;</p>
        
        <p>It&#8217;s quite okay to have an hypothesis, trying to falsify or strengthen it. But
        one can simply describe phenomenas as one sees fit. This is what separates
        researchers from journalists.</p>
        
        <p>Lastly we concluded that <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> probably was to different than other
        services that I&#8217;m about to study. I should focus on 3-4 sites:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Flickr (since it&#8217;s a prime example of folksonomy, interesting tag usage with
        clustering)</li>
        <li>Facebook (since it&#8217;s the fastest growing and innovating social network site,
        first with api for application developers)</li>
        <li>Amazon (early in using sociality for presenting users with relevant items,
        and early with trying out new things as tagging, wiki)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My supervisor recommended that I read an article by David Beer and Roger
        Burrows called: &#8221;<a href="http://www.socresonline.org.uk/12/5/17.html">Sociology and, of and in Web 2.0: Some Initial
        Considerations</a>&#8221; published by <a href="http://www.socresonline.org.uk/">Sociological Research Online</a>. While
        reading the article I got some new ideas related to my research:</p>
        
        <p>The authors categorizes Web 2.0 services into:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Wikis</li>
        <li>Folksonomies</li>
        <li>Mashups</li>
        <li>Social Networking Sites</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This categorization seems quite sound and can probably be used in my thesis to
        differentiate the sites I&#8217;ll study.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Folksonomy
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://del.icio.us/">Delicious</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Social Networking Sites
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://underskog.no">Underskog</a></li>

        <li>Ecommerce
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Note that several of these sites shares characteristics from the other groups
        it&#8217;s not categorized into. Relating to my research it would also be beneficial
        to study a wiki which I find to be a prime example of fully organic social
        navigation.</p>

        <p>The first priority is to create a taxonomy with an associated terminology. When
        this part of the research is nearing completion one can study Urørt, trying to
        locate one or maximum two new navigational designs. Based on this one can start
        to implement the prototype.</p>
        
        <p>When looking at web services as Facebook and Flickr one should focus on the
        core functionality, not third party applications leveraged either inside
        programming APIs (Facebook) or outside applications using open APIs. If time
        permits it could be interesting to look at one or two of these just as an
        example of API usage and mashups.</p>
        
        <p>Should maybe study <a href="http://underskog.no/">Underskog</a> since it&#8217;s the most interesting Norwegian service.
        Gisle sent me an invitation and I signed up for the service.</p>
        
        <p>Another interesting service that could be subject for investigation is Second
        Life. It&#8217;s navigational design is vastly different than any other services
        planned to research. It&#8217;s largely based on spatial navigation.</p>
        
        <p>We discussed how throughout I should be when collecting data from the different
        sites. The technique I used at Flickr could very well not be applicable for
        Amazon. It&#8217;s important to think about what resolution one are looking at the
        problem with.</p>
        
        <p>We agreed that I should focus on finishing my analysis of Flickr. Mapping the
        navigational patterns at Flickr could prove very difficult and time consuming.
        Should not use much time on this, but focus on the textual analysis.</p>

          Joining the RECORD Project at SINTEF
        </a>
      </h2>
      <div class='entry-content'>
        <p>My supervisor advised me to contact <a href="http://sintef.no/">SINTEF</a> regarding their research project
        called <a href="http://www.sintef.no/content/page1____16246.aspx">RECORD</a>. It was plausible that my research correlated with that of the
        RECORD project. I attended a meeting with the project&#8217;s coordinator Asbj&oslash;rn
        F&oslash;lstad on Thursday the 11th of October where we discussed possible ways of
        cooperating.
        The RECORD Project</p>
        
        <p>Shortly summarized this project have three different themes:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Usagepatterns (mainly with regard to audio-visual systems).</li>
        <li>Design of navigation (again mostly for audio-visual systems) and design of
        web communities. How can we design such communities so that become self
        sufficient (with a focus on not only the technical sides)?</li>
        <li>Evaluation by leveraging a community of test users for giving feedback on
        various prototypical work. One tries to find a golden path between throughout
        upfront planning and &#8220;launch and learn&#8221;.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>SINTEF have mobilized 3000 users which can be used for survey purposes. A
        handful of these can be taken in for usability testing in labs.</p>
        
        <p>One of SINTEF&#8217;s collaboration partners in the RECORD project is
        the <a href="http://nrk.no/urort">Ur&oslash;rt</a> service of the National Broadcasting
        Corporation. After talking to Morten Skogly of Ur&oslash; it was agreed that I
        should develop a transparent prototype on top of their service as part of my
        research. Technically this prototype would be realized by using the
        Greasemonkey plugin for Firefox and transparently adding a layer of
        navigational structures on top of the existing service.</p>
        
        <p>Some time during November or December (after I&#8217;ve concluded my initial studies)
        it&#8217;s quite possible that me and Asbj&oslash;rn from SINTEF visit the Ur&oslash;rt team in
        Trondheim to discuss this project more closely.</p>

        <h3>The Aims of My Research</h3>
        
        <p>My thesis should be categorized as one that is informing design. We know what
        the term social navigation is - it&#8217;s (more or less clearly) defined. What we
        know little about are how to use such navigational paradigms in the real world.
        There are many examples of web sites/applications where social navigation are
        blossoming but it&#8217;s creators does not use the term. Could it be that such
        navigational designs are grown organically and implicitly as a result of the
        creators&#8217; focus on sociality?</p>
        
        <p>My research should answer how social navigation can be (and is) leveraged in
        our modern web age in real projects. Social navigation is a central part of the
        web today but it&#8217;s now mostly referred to with the broader term Web 2.0.</p>
        
        <p>One part of this work should be to define or redefine several concepts related
        to social navigation and thereby try to create a clear taxonomy of different
        types of social navigation.</p>
        
        <h3>Feedback on Delivery</h3>
        
        <p>My supervisor was confused by my usage of two tables to convey my content
        inventory of Flickr. Even though both tables have an id column for cross
        referencing it is hard to keep track of these as the columns in table two refer
        to content on the previous page (link name and location). Use of URL is
        probably not needed as it&#8217;s the least useful of my current columns and it takes
        up a great deal of visual space.</p>
        
        <p>He was impressed with the level of detail I had recorded, but noted that I&#8217;d
        have to keep in mind that this process should be repeated on several other
        sites and this would leave me with a great deal of work.</p>
        
        <p>We discussed that I had noticed several flaws of Flickr&#8217;s labeling when
        collecting data. Irregularities like this are not relevant for my research but
        it could be wise to note such things and that information architects probably
        would study this issue further. I could easily choose which of the titles
        (title tag in the head or h1 tag in the body) to use depending of which were
        most descriptive. I could even introduce my own title or adaptation of titles
        (in apostrophes) where the available titles were severely lacking in describing
        the site&#8217;s content (apparent in cluster pages for example).</p>
        
        <p>The use of variables in my inventory was sound and well understood. I could
        however include examples of what the variables could convey in my tabular
        listing of them (like Cannon for $camera).</p>
        
        <p>The inventory and subsequent analysis should contain screen shots of the most
        striking and interesting features.</p>
        
        <p>Graphical representations (I had navigational maps based Beck&#8217;s maps of the
        London tube system in mind) could very well be included in the content analysis
        phase. These should not be substitutes of textual description and analysis but
        rather add to it.</p>
        
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        
        <p>Privacy was included as one of the topics in my thesis proposal. We discussed
        whether I should focus on this issue. We concluded that I should ignore this
        issue in the beginning and maybe focus on it later on if time permits since
        it&#8217;s a topic of high interest to my supervisor.</p>
        
        <h3>Further Work</h3>
        
        <p>We decided on a fortnightly schedule for my supervisions every other Monday at
        15:00. I should aim to deliver products that my supervisor can read trough on
        Fridays the week before.</p>
        
        <p>Until my next delivery (before Friday 19th of October) I should take a step
        back and try to think about the broader issues of my research and with this
        write a first draft of the introduction chapter. After this is completed I
        should continue with my grunt work on Flickr (content analysis), creating my
        method as I go and thinking about my supervisors comments above.</p>

        <li>Ch. 21: The literature review chapter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The following chapters should be read next (when they become relevant):</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Ch. 14: Quality in qualitative research</li>
        <li>Ch. 15: Evaluating qualitative research</li>
        <li>Ch. 22: The methodology chapter</li>
        <li>Ch. 23: Writing your data chapters</li>
        <li>Ch. 24: The final chapter</li>
        <li>Ch. 26: Effective qualitative research</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The rest of the chapters can safely be skipped just by looking at their titles.</p>
        
        <p>I think it would be beneficial to revisit parts of this text at later stages in
        my research to check that I’m asking the right questions and taking the best
        approaches. All in all I found most of the advice in this book to sound very
        sound (even though parts of it are geared to far away from the part of social
        science that is interesting for general computer scientists).</p>

        <p>I started to rewrite my rakefile for latex authoring today. The focus of this
        endeavor is a more modular and object oriented design in addition to more
        intelligent decisions about how many latex runs that really are needed.
        Stripping of LaTeX&#8217;s overly verbose output would also be nice (inspiration
        drawn from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile">latex-make</a>). My last effort in this vein was more of a fast hack. I
        have thought about maybe using behavior driven development with rSpec on this
        project down the road. I also plan to release my results under a liberal
        license once I have something that is ready for human consumption.</p>

        <p>The past days I&#8217;ve been doing a pretty throughout content inventory for <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>.
        I decided to introduce a set of variables to better describe the sites
        different pages (prefixed with a dollar sign as found in UNIX shell
        scripting). The better part of the day was involved with finishing data
        collection for the content inventory, typing up a tabular explanation of these
        variables, and further describe my approach for content inventory.</p>
        
        <p>I did some library searching for academic papers where content inventory was
